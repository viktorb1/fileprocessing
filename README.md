# File Processing Tools

## proj1.py
This script assumes that `proj1.py` is located one folder above the `sample-files` folder

Run the script as usual with:
```bash
python3 proj1.py
```

## proj2.py
This script is a generalized version of `proj1.py`. You can specify the following arguments:
- --json_file: name of input json file to parse data, this could be multiples
- --output_filename: name of output filename
- --time_str_format: convert timestamp in given string format before writing to .csv file
ex: --time_str_format '%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S' would be something like '21/11/06 16:30:12'
--time_str_format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' would be something like '2021-11-12 23:04:14'
- -h, --human-readable: convert size bw_bytes in human readable format in power of
1024 before writing to .csv file. ex: 21648 is 21.2, etc.
